# Drum_Kit

Welcome to the Drum Kit project! ü•Å

With the help of this project, one can create a basic and interactive drum kit that allows to play different drum sounds by clicking on the virtual drum buttons or by pressing the relevant keys that are shown on the screen. It's an enjoyable method to play around with music and make own beats!
